# Hestia

> "In Ancient Greek religion and mythology, Hestia is the virgin goddess of the hearth, the right ordering of domesticity,
> the family, the home, and the state." - [Hestia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestia)

During my time as a software developer, I've written a lot of interesting pieces of code that solve very broad or very
specific problems. I also end up writing a lot of code I've written before, over and over. So, I decided to start a repository
of some basic content I'd like to not have to rewrite. If it helps someone, even better! I'm also getting more and more into
writing home automation and management software, and so Hestia seemed appropriate.

I'm always open to collaboration and criticism, so feel free to comment and contribute.

### Hestia.Base

This project contains a lot of utility classes, as well as geometry content I've written in my attempts to learn more about geometry
and writing my own 2D/3D games and applications more from scratch.

### Hestia.Base.gRPC

This project contains common content I end up rewriting often when making gRPC projects.

### Hestia.Base.ServiceBus

The project provides a basic foundation of writing connectors for Azure Service Bus Queues and Topics.

### Hestia.Web.Examples.gRPC and Hestia.Web.Examples.gRPC.Client

This project showcases a quick, no frills, example of standing up and connecting to a gRPC server in a code-first manner.
