# Hestia

> "In Ancient Greek religion and mythology, Hestia is the virgin goddess of the hearth, the right ordering of domesticity,
> the family, the home, and the state." - [Hestia - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestia)

I'm getting more and more into writing home automation and management software, and I also write a lot of home projects where
I find myself rewriting snippets and utilities. So I decided to create this repository to store some common things I like to use,
and Hestia seemed appropriate. I'm always open to collaboration and criticism, so feel free to comment and/or contribute if you'd
like.

## Projects

### Hestia.Base

This project contains some basic generalized utilities like comparison tools and some additional math functions, as well as a compliant
predictable guid generator. I'm also heavily interested in computational geometry and physics, so I also have a rudimentary geometry library
I'm working on as I learn more.
